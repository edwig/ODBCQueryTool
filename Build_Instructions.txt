Build instructions for QL-Language project
==========================================

1) The source code of SQLComponents (https://github.com/edwig/SQLComponents)
   is no longer a part of this source tree. 
   See that project for the full workings of that component.
   Instead a "SQLComponents.zip" file is delivered in the root directory
2) Unzip the "SQLComponents.zip" file with the "here" option.
   This should leave you with the following:
   /Include/SQLComponents       directory with all interface headers
   /lib/SQLComponents_XXX.lib   Four library files debug/release Win32/X64
3) Load the QL_Language project in VisualStudio
4) Hit the "build" key.
